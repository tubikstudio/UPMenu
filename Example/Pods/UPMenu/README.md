Menu control from [Upper](https://uppertodo.com)

![Preview](https://github.com/tubikstudio/UPMenu/blob/master/demo.gif)

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 9
- Swift 4

## Installation

#### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
pod 'UPMenu'
```

#### Manual Installation

Add <b> Source </b> folder to your project, that's all.

### Usage

* If you install UPMenu from Cocoapods, be sure to import the module into your View Controller:

```swift
import UPMenu
```

* [Code] Create menu view, and set point, where it should be located:

```swift
let upMenu = UPMenu(frame: view.frame)
upMenu.startPoint = CGPoint(x: view.frame.width - 60, y: view.frame.height - 80)
view.addSubview(upMenu)
```

* [InterfaceBuilder] Add UIView, set it's class to `UPMenu`, create IBOutlet and update start point (look at Example project for more details):
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var upMenuFromStoryboard: UPMenu!

override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)

    upMenuFromStoryboard.startPoint = CGPoint(x: view.frame.width - 60, y: view.frame.height - 80)
}
```

* Set delegate and  implement `UPMenuDelegate` protocol to get notified about UPMenu events:

```swift
upMenu.delegate = self

extension ViewController: UPMenuDelegate {

    func upMenu(_ upMenu: UPMenu, didSelectMenuItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        print("\(upMenu.menuItemsTitles[indexPath.row])")
    }

}
```

### Customisation

* Set menu items titles:

```swift
upMenu.updateMenuItemsTitles(with: ["üë§ Profile", "üéØ Activity", "‚öôÔ∏è Settings"])
```

* Set menu items list height:

```swift
upMenu.menuItemsListHeight = 217
```

* Set menu items cells backgorund color and font:

```swift
upMenu.appearance.menuItemCellBackgroundColor = UIColor.black
upMenu.appearance.menuItemCellTitleFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 36)
```

* Set closed menu color:

```swift
upMenu.appearance.closedMenuColor = UIColor.white
```

* Set title view background color:

```swift
upMenu.appearance.titleViewBackgorundColor = UIColor.white
```

* Set menu items view background color:

```swift
upMenu.appearance.menuItemsViewBackgroundColor = UIColor.black
```

* Set custom title view:

```swift
let label = UILabel(frame: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: CGSize(width: 150, height: 150)))
label.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 56)
label.textAlignment = .center
label.text = "üê∂"

upMenu.addTitleView(label)
```
